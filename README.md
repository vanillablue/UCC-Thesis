# UCC-Thesis : DEEP LEARNING FOR TIME-SERIES PREDICTION OF AUTOMOBILE STOCKS

Most of the major trading companies now use algorithmic trading in order to reduce the risk in the decision making process. The large number of institutions and individuals using algorithmic trading to predict financial markets, has given rise to a need to make these estimates more accurate as well as robust to changing economic situations. These models uses time series prediction as well as Sentiment Analysis from real-time news feeds to calculate the estimates in real time.  Various Machine Learning techniques such as SVMs, Random Forests and Regression in combination with condition based logic were traditionally used to arrive at these estimates. Recently, Deep Learning techniques such  as    Multilayer Perceptron Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks as well   as  LSTMs are widely  being used to  forecast financial market prices with higher accuracies. In this work, we try to predict the stock prices for automobile companies traded in the New York Stock Exchange(NYSE) between the years 2015 and 2020 using time-series analysis.  Initially a model that predicts only the high price is constructed. Then , a model that predicts High, Low and Close price is developed. The various models are compared and the factors driving these automobile prices such as oil price and the state of the economy  are also studied.
